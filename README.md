# Cardiovascular-Risk-Assessment-System
Machine Learning-Based Cardiovascular Risk Prediction: A Comparative Analysis of Classification Models

## üéØ Objective
Developed and compared machine learning models to predict cardiovascular disease risk using patient health indicators, achieving **82.83% accuracy** with logistic regression. This project supports early intervention strategies in preventive healthcare.

## üìä Dataset
- **Size**: 119,795 patient records
- **Features**: 18 health indicators including diabetes status, physical activity, smoking habits
- **Target**: Binary classification (Heart Disease: Yes/No)
- **Source**: CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System

## üîç Key Findings
- **Top Risk Factors**: Diabetes, mobility difficulties, general health status, physical activity, smoking
- **Model Performance**: Logistic Regression (82.83% accuracy) outperformed Decision Tree (90%+ accuracy with higher false positives)
- **Clinical Relevance**: 94.66% precision in identifying high-risk patients
